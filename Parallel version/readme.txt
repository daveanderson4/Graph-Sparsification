A Parallelized Graph Sparsification Example
David G. Anderson
2016

In this version of the code, step 3 of the unweighted
graph sparsification algorithm is performed in parallel,
which is the bottleneck of computation.  Step 3 takes
the computed lambda_hat and searches for the next usable
column.

Computations were run on multiple cores of a single node
of NERSCâ€™s Edison.  The problem has dimensions:
n=1145, k=492, l=493
